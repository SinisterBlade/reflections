What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When a repository is initialized, git begins tracking all the files in the directory. A hidden folder called '.git' is created in the current folder. This '.git' folder contains metadata.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area allows us to select the files that are to be commited. This can be useful if we have multiple files but only some correspond to a single logical change.
