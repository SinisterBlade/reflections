What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When a repository is initialized, git begins tracking all the files in the directory. A hidden folder called '.git' is created in the current folder. This '.git' folder contains metadata.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area allows us to select the files that are to be commited. This can be useful if we have multiple files but only some correspond to a single logical change.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	We can use 'git diff' which can compare the files in the working directory and staging area. Similarly, we can use 'git diff --staged' to compare the staging area with the most recent commit.
