When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	Using a remote repository allows us to share code with other developers and collaborators. It also allows us to access the code on multiple computers easily.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	It is possible that we are working on an incomplete feature locally and don't want the changes on the remote repository to be added just yet.
